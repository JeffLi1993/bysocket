Cache vs Buffer

The terms "buffer" and "cache" tend to be used interchangeably; note however they represent different things. A buffer is used traditionally as an intermediate temporary store for data between a fast and a slow entity. As one party would have to wait for the other affecting performance, the buffer alleviates this by allowing entire blocks of data to move at once rather then in small chunks. The data is written and read only once from the buffer. Furthermore, the buffers are visible to at least one party which is aware of it.

A cache on the other hand by definition is hidden and neither party is aware that caching occurs.It as well improves performance but does that by allowing the same data to be read multiple times in a fast fashion.

A further explanation of the differences between two can be found here.

缓存（Cache） vs 缓冲区（Buffer）

缓存和缓冲区两个术语往往可以互换着使用。但注意，它们代表着不同的东西。缓冲区是作用于快和慢速实体之间的中间临时存储。一块缓冲区必须等待其他并影响性能，通过允许一次性移动整个数据块而不是小块来缓解。数据从缓冲区读写只有一次。因此缓冲区对至少一方是可见的。

另一方面，缓存根据定义是隐性的，双方不会知道缓存的发生。它提高了性能，但允许以快速的方式多次读取相同的数据。

```

At its core, the abstraction applies caching to Java methods, reducing thus the number of executions based on the information available in the cache. That is, each time a targeted method is invoked, the abstraction will apply a caching behavior checking whether the method has been already executed for the given arguments. If it has, then the cached result is returned without having to execute the actual method; if it has not, then method is executed, the result cached and returned to the user so that, the next time the method is invoked, the cached result is returned. This way, expensive methods (whether CPU or IO bound) can be executed only once for a given set of parameters and the result reused without having to actually execute the method again. The caching logic is applied transparently without any interference to the invoker.
